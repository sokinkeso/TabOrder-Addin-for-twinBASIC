With this addin, you can call any of your favorite tools from inside the twinBasic IDE,
like: Hex editors, debuggers, console window, zip/unzip tools, calculators, versioning control tools, and many other!

With this addin, you can easily fix the controls TabOrder inside a Form/Usercontrol designer of the twinBasic IDE.
In this first release two modes are available:
1) Import the form controls in the list and move each control in the desired order using the Move buttons on the right of the list.
2) Record a new TabOrder. Clear the list and click the [Record Tab Order] button. Then click the controls on the form with the desired order.



Features:
---------
- List with the controls on the form. The list has 5 columns:
  Name: The control Name
  Type: The control type (or class name)
  TabIndex: The control tabIndex
  TabStop : The control TabStop property value (True, False OR N/A)
  Text/Caption: The value of the Text/Caption property, if it exists (N/A  if not exist)

- Change TabOrder buttons (on the right of the list)
  [Move to The top] : moves the selected control to the top of the list
  [Move up] : moves the selected control one position up
  [Move down] : moves the selected control one position down
  [Move to The bottom] : moves the selected control to the bottom of the list

- Delete selected control from the list (Bin delete button)

- Delete all controls from the list (Clear list button)

- [Import from Form] button, reads all the controls of the form and show them in the list.
  When this button is clicked, after the controls are imported, any duplicate or non-continuous indices are fixed.

- [Record Tab Order] button, when active (turns Red color) clicking on the controls of the form
  each clicked control appears in the list.

- [Auto TabOrder] button, automatically sets the TabIndex property of the controls, based on their position
  on the form. For better results, first make any necessary alignments.

- Chekcbox for including controls without TabStop property. Use this option, to include controls like:
  Label, Frame etc, that don't have the TabStop property.
  (TabIndex of these controls is used with mnemonics)

- [Save to form] button, saves the current list TabOrder and TabStop status in the form.
  This action can be undone, pressing the Undo button of the IDE

- [Close] button, closes the addin form.

- Addin form's position and size is saved.
